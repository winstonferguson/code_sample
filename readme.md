# Code Sample 

This sample should give a fair reflection of my capacity as a developer. It's pulled from one of my private repositories.

As someone constantly striving to improve, I find it hard to feel proud of any code I've written about a week after I've written it. However, I am proud of what this code can do and it's improvement over what I would have written before it. 

## What

This is the model directory in a Rails 7 application that uses the Spree e-commerce library. It significantly extends the packaged e-commerce functionality for product customizations. This includes CAD and AI feautures as well as the capacity to use products in the creation of other products.

## Why

* It should give an idea of how I approach application architecture.
* It does some complex things but, I believe it to be understandable.
* It's honest - it's code I've written when pressed for time that only has to answer to myself.
* I can talk about.
